# A BI-RADS 4 Lesions Analysis System (BL4AS)

This repository supports the research study "An Interpretable AI System for Stratifying High-risk Breast Lesions to Reduce False-positive MRI Diagnoses." To safeguard the study's intellectual property during the peer review process, we have elected to defer publication of the analysis code and trained models until the manuscript completes journal review. For inquiries regarding this work, please feel free to contact our team.

## Clinical Impact
- **Reduces unnecessary biopsies** by improving specificity (89.9% vs radiologists' 49.1%, p=0.014)
- **Decreases inter-reader variability** by 24.5% across experience levels
- **Lowers false-positive rates** by 27.3% in multicenter validation
- **Provides refined risk stratification** of BI-RADS 4 lesions into clinically actionable 4A/4B/4C subcategories

## Key Features
âœ” **Advanced Architecture**  
Foundation model leveraging multiphase DCE-MRI spatiotemporal dynamics

âœ” **Rigorous Validation**  
- Trained on 2,803 lesions from 2,686 patients  
- AUC 0.893-0.930 across external & prospective tests  
- Outperformed radiologists in NPV (92.1% vs 84.3%)

âœ” **Clinical Integration**  
- Interpretable Grad-CAM visualizations  
- Compatible with standard PACS workflows  
- Improves both senior and junior radiologists' accuracy
